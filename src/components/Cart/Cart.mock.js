        "React is a JavaScript library developed for one main reason—to build reusable UI components that present ever-changing data. The React philosophy is to focus solely on the user interface. In model-view-controller (MVC) terminology, React is the view. Because it has to work with models and other libraries, it's designed to play nicely with pretty much any other framework, router, style, and model library. And it's well-supported—React emerged from Instagram and is now used by Facebook, Asana, Khan Academy, and Atom among many more. React Quickly is for anyone who wants to learn React.js fast. This hands-on book teaches needed concepts by using lots of examples, tutorials, and a large main project that gets built throughout. It starts with the basics, including how React fits into applications, JSX, and handling states, and events. Next, it explores core topics like components, forms, and data. Finally, the book dives into React integration topics, like unit testing and isomorphic JavaScript with Express.js, and Gulp. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.",
